# MusicQueueBeGone
### Don't you just hate that annoying popup when you select "Play Next" in Apple Music?
* Get rid of the queue menu and add a slight vibration to let you know your song has been added to the queue, but without annoying you by taking up your entire screen!
* Works on iOS 10 to iOS 13!
* My very first tweak ever!
* iPad users do not have a Haptic Engine, so we have added Sound Settings you can choose from!


### MTAC
* This would not be possible without the help of MTAC, he has helped me every step of the way and I couldn't have done this without him. Go check him out on Twitter: [MTAC](https://twitter.com/mtac8)
